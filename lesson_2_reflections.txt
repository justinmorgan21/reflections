What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates another folder called .git that contains all the metadata related to the history of the project.  This functionality needs to be added in order to do checkouts, diffs, logs, etc., on my project.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a container that you can fill with all the things from the working directory that you want to make a commit with to the repository.  This allows you to pick and choose in a customized way the things to commit.  The value is flexibility.
